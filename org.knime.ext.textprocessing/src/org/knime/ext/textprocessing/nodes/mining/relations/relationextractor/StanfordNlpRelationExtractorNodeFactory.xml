    <name>StanfordNLP Relation Extractor</name>
    <shortDescription>Extracts relation triplets from documents.
    </shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Extracts relations triplets contained in sentences of a document by investigating relations of tagged named-entities.<br/>
			<br/>
			The node can be used in two different ways by either checking the <i>Apply preprocessing</i> option or not. 
			If the option is selected, the node takes care of part-of-speech (POS) and named-entity (NE) tagging as well as lemmatizing. 
			Stanford CoreNLP standard settings are used in this case. However, tags are not applied to the documents, 
			since the preprocessing is only applied internally. If the option is unchecked, it is necessary 
			to provide a column with tagged documents (POS and NE) as well as a column containing lemmatized documents. 
			Lemmatized documents consist of terms that were converted to their canonical, dictionary or citation form.<br/>
			<i>Note:</i> Creating the same pipeline by using KNIME's Stanford nodes with default settings 
			will not necessarily lead to the same results as using the <i>Apply preprocessing</i> option, 
			since KNIME is using the Penn-Treebank (PTB) tag set. This tag set uses the <tt>SYM</tt> tag for
			any kind of punctuation and quotation marks. However, Stanford CoreNLP uses a modified version of the 
			PTB tag set to distinguish these symbols, since they are important for dependency parsing and 
			natural logic annotation.<br/>
			<br/>
			The node creates four new columns: two object columns containing named-entities, one column containing the type of relation with the highest confidence and 
			a column containing the confidence for this relation. The node handles classic named-entities like <tt>PERSON</tt>, <tt>LOCATION</tt> and
			<tt>ORGANIZATION</tt>.<br/>
			Relation types that can be extracted are <tt>Live_In</tt>, <tt>OrgBased_In</tt>, <tt>Located_In</tt>, <tt>Work_For</tt> 
			and <tt>_NR</tt>. <br/> <tt>_NR</tt> specifies no relation between two entities. A detailed explanation of StanfordNLP's approach for relation extraction can be found in <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/relms2011.pdf">this article</a>.<br/>
			<br/>
			<i>Note</i>: Relation Extraction is a computationally expensive operation. For the usage of this
            node it is recommended to run KNIME with at least 4GB of heap space. To increase the heap space, change
            the -Xmx setting in the knime.ini file.<br/>
			<br/>      
            This node is based on Stanford CoreNLP 3.9.1.<br/>
